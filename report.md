## Part 1. Ready-made docker
+ Take the official docker image from nginx and download it using docker pull.

    `docker pull nginx`

    ![](screenshots/screen1.png "Nginx image download")

+ Check for the docker image with docker images

    `docker images`

    ![](screenshots/screen2.png "Show docker images")

+ Run docker image with docker run -d [image_id|repository]

    `docker run -d nginx`

    ![](screenshots/screen3.png "Run nginx image")

+ Check that the image is running with docker ps

    `docker ps`

    ![](screenshots/screen4.png "Containers running")

+ View container information with docker inspect [container_id|container_name]
+ From the command output define and write in the report the container size, list of mapped ports and container ip

    `docker inspect --size 3e | grep -E -A 1 "SizeRootFs|ExposedPorts|\"IPAddress\""`

    ![](screenshots/screen5.png "Info about container")

+ Stop docker image with docker stop [container_id|container_name]
    
    `dokcer stop 3e`

    ![](screenshots/screen6.png "Stopping container")

+ Check that the image has stopped with docker ps

    `docker ps`

    ![](screenshots/screen7.png "Containers running")

+ Run docker with ports 80 and 443 in container, mapped to the same ports on the local machine, with run command

    `docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 nginx`

    ![](screenshots/screen8.png "Run nginx server")

+ Check that the nginx start page is available in the browser at localhost:80

    ![](screenshots/screen9.png "Nginx start page")

+ Restart docker container with docker restart [container_id|container_name]
    
    `docker restart e3`

    ![](screenshots/screen10.png "Restart container")

+ Check in any way that the container is running

    `docker ps`

    ![](screenshots/screen11.png "Containers running")


## Part 2. Operations with container

+ Read the nginx.conf configuration file inside the docker container with the exec command

    `docker exec e3 cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

    ![](screenshots/screen12.png "Nginx configuration")

+ Create a nginx.conf file on a local machine

    `cat nginx.conf`

    ![](screenshots/screen13.png "New nginx configuration")

+ Configure it on the /status path to return the nginx server status page

    ![](screenshots/screen14.png "Setting Nginx configuration")

+ Copy the created nginx.conf file inside the docker image using the docker cp command

    `docker cp nginx.conf e3:/etc/nginx/`

    ![](screenshots/screen15.png "Copy configuration nginx to container")

+ Restart nginx inside the docker image with exec

    `docker exec e3 nginx -s reload`

    ![](screenshots/screen16.png "Restart nginx")

+ Check that localhost:80/status returns the nginx server status page

    ![](screenshots/screen17.png "Nginx status page")

+ Export the container to a container.tar file with the export command

    `docker export e3 -o container.tar`

    ![](screenshots/screen18.png "Ð¡ontainer archiving")

+ Stop the container

    `docker stop e3`

    ![](screenshots/screen19.png "Stopping container")

+ Delete the image with docker rmi [image_id|repository]without removing the container first

    `docker rmi -f eea`

    ![](screenshots/screen20.png "Deleting nginx image")

+ Delete stopped container

    ![](screenshots/screen21.png "Deleting container")

+ Import the container back using the importcommand

    `docker import -c 'ENTRYPOINT ["/docker-entrypoint.sh"]' -c 'CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]' container.tar`

    ![](screenshots/screen22.png "Container unzipping")

+ Run the imported container
    `docker run e4`

    ![](screenshots/screen23.png "Run imported container")

+ Check that localhost:80/status returns the nginx server status page

    ![](screenshots/screen24.png "Server status")

+ Put the nginx.conf file under ./nginx/nginx.conf (you will need this later)

    `docker cp 43:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf ./nginx/nginx.conf`

## Part 3. Mini web server

+ Write a mini server in C and FastCgi that will return a simple page saying Hello World!

    ```c
    #include "fcgi_stdio.h"
    #include <stdlib.h>

    int main(void)
    {
        while(FCGI_Accept() >= 0)
        {
            printf("Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\nHello World!");
        }
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    [server code](server/server.c)

+ Run the written mini server via spawn-fcgi on port 8080

    + Install gcc, libfcgi-dev and spawn-fcgi

        `apt update`

        `apt install gcc`
    
        `apt install libfcgi-dev`
    
        `apt install spawn-fcgi`

    + Compile server

        `gcc main.c -lfcgi -o server`

    + Run server

        `spawn-fcgi -p 8080 server`


+ Write your own nginx.conf that will proxy all requests from port 81 to 127.0.0.1:8080

    [nginx.conf](server/nginx.conf)

+ Check that browser on localhost:81 returns the page you wrote

    ![](screenshots/screen25.png "Fastcgi server")

+ Put the nginx.conf file under ./nginx/nginx.conf (you will need this later)

    `docker cp 43:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf ./nginx/nginx.conf`


## Part 4. Your own docker

+ Write your own docker image that:

    1. builds mini server sources on FastCgi from Part 3


    2. runs it on port 8080

    3. copies inside the image written ./nginx/nginx.conf


    4. runs nginx.

    [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)

+ Build the written docker image with docker build, specifying the name and tag

    `docker build -t my_nginx:v01 .`

+ Check with docker images that everything is built correctly

    ![](screenshots/screen26.png "Docker images")

+ Run the built docker image by mapping port 81 to 80 on the local machine and mapping the ./nginx folder inside the container to the address where the nginx configuration files are located (see Part 2)

    `docker run -d -p 80:81 -v nginx:/etc/nginx/ my_nginx:v01`

+ Check that the page of the written mini server is available on localhost:80

    ![](screenshots/screen27.png "Fastcgi server")

+ Add proxying of /status page in ./nginx/nginx.conf to return the nginx server status

    `location /status { stub_status }`

+ Restart docker image

    `docker restart 80`

+ Check that localhost:80/status now returns a page with nginx status

    ![](screenshots/screen28.png "Server status")

## Part 5. Dockle

+ Check the image from the previous task with dockle [image_id|repository]

    ![](screenshots/screen29.png "Docker image with errors")

+ Fix the image so that there are no errors or warnings when checking with dockle

    ![](screenshots/screen30.png "Docker image without errors")

[Dockerfile](part_5/Dockerfile)

## Part 6. Basic Docker Compose

+ Write a docker-compose.yml file, using which:

    1. Start the docker container from Part 5 (it must work on local network, i.e., you don't need to use EXPOSE instruction and map ports to local machine)

    2. Start the docker container with nginx which will proxy all requests from port 8080 to port 81 of the first container

    Map port 8080 of the second container to port 80 of the local machine

+ Stop all running containers

    ![](screenshots/screen31.png "Running containers")

+ Build and run the project with the docker-compose build and docker-compose up commands

    `docker-compose build`

    ![](screenshots/screen32.png "builing containers")

    `docker-compose up`

    ![](screenshots/screen33.png "Running containers")

+ Check that the browser returns the page you wrote on localhost:80 as before

    ![](screenshots/screen34.png "Fastcgi server")
